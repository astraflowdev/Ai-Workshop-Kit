## WHAT TO SAY AT KEY MOMENTS

### Opening Hook (Slide 2)
"Quick question - and be honest. How many of you have used ChatGPT for assignments? [pause for hands] Gemini? Claude? GitHub Copilot? [pause] Look around! Almost everyone. You're all AI USERS. But in the next 2 hours, you're going to become AI BUILDERS. That's a completely different game."

### The Pivot (Slide 5)
[Let the slide speak for 2 seconds]
"You can USE these tools. But what if... [pause 2 seconds] ...you could BUILD these tools? That's what we're here for."

### First API Call Success (Slide 26)
"THERE IT IS! Do you see that? You just sent a message to a 175-billion parameter AI model. It processed your request on servers somewhere in the world, ran through trillions of calculations, and sent you back a response. And you did it with 10 lines of code. You're now an AI developer. Officially. That's it. You crossed the line."

### Career Reality Check (Slide 44)
"Let me be real with you. There's no such thing as an 'AI Engineer' job for freshers. That's clickbait. What EXISTS are Backend Engineers who can integrate LLMs. Full-stack developers building AI features. ML Engineers deploying models. These are REAL roles with REAL salaries at REAL companies. And you can get them."

### Final Message (Slide 52)
"Two hours ago, you were an AI user. Now you're an AI builder. You have working code. You have a roadmap. You know what to do next. The opportunity is RIGHT NOW. Not next year. Not next month. NOW. Companies are hiring. Salaries are high. Competition is still low. But that window won't stay open forever. So here's what you're going to do: Tonight, you're going to push this code to GitHub. This weekend, you're going to start Project 2. Next month, you're going to have a portfolio that gets interviews. Go build something amazing. The future belongs to builders."
